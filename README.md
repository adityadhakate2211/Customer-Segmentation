# Customer-Segmentation
This project, analyzed on Google Colab, segments e-commerce customers based on purchasing behavior using ecom.csv data. Steps include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and K-Means clustering. This enables targeted marketing, better customer service, and improved business strategies.
# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for performing customer segmentation on an e-commerce dataset. The segmentation helps in identifying distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior and other relevant features. This analysis can be used to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance overall business strategies.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts to clean and preprocess the raw customer data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Segmentation Techniques**: Implementation of various clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Methods to evaluate the performance of the segmentation using silhouette scores and other relevant metrics.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of customer segments to provide insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy

### Installation/Procedure

Process of Running the Code in Colab
Open Google Colab:

Go to Google Colab in your web browser.
Upload the Notebook:

Click on "File" in the top-left corner.
Select "Upload notebook" from the dropdown menu.
Click on the "Choose File" button and upload the customer_segmentation.ipynb file.
Upload the Dataset:

In the Colab interface, find the "Files" tab on the left sidebar.
Click the "Upload" button and select the ecom.csv file.
This will upload the dataset to the Colab environment.
Mount Google Drive (if necessary):

If your dataset is in Google Drive, you can mount your drive using the following code:
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Follow the authentication steps to mount your Google Drive.
Run the Cells:

Go back to the notebook (customer_segmentation.ipynb).
Run each cell sequentially by clicking the play button on the left side of each cell or by pressing Shift + Enter.
Inspect Results:

As you run the cells, you will see the output directly below each cell.
Visualizations and other results will be displayed inline.
Important Notes
Ensure that the dataset ecom.csv is in the same directory as the notebook if you are not using Google Drive.
Adjust any file paths in the notebook if necessary to correctly point to the uploaded dataset.
Example Code Snippets
Loading Data
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/content/ecom.csv')
Data Cleaning
python
Copy code
# Example: Drop missing values
data = data.dropna()
Feature Engineering
python
Copy code
# Example: Create total spend feature
data['TotalSpend'] = data['Quantity'] * data['UnitPrice']
Clustering
python
Copy code
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Example: Apply K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(data[['TotalSpend', 'Quantity']])
Visualization
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: Scatter plot of clusters
plt.scatter(data['TotalSpend'], data['Quantity'], c=data['Cluster'])
plt.xlabel('Total Spend')
plt.ylabel('Quantity')
plt.title('Customer Segments')
plt.show()
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the customer segmentation analysis in Google Colab and explore the results.
